<h1>Ki11ahB</h1>

<p><strong>Ki11ahB</strong> is a Canadian Twitch streamer and content creator known for his speedruns and hitless challenge runs in the <em>Soulsborne</em> genre of games. He gained notoriety in the hitless community for his highly optimized gameplay, signature comedic style, and dedication to the craft of challenge running.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>

<p>Ki11ahB began streaming on Twitch in the late 2010s, rising to prominence in the <em>Soulsborne</em> and <em>FromSoftware</em> speedrunning communities. His breakthrough moment came with a notable <em>Bloodborne</em> speedrun in which he completed the game in <strong>00:41:04</strong><span class="reference"><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ki11ahb/clip/BoldBreakablePlumberCoolStoryBob-uL4R3K8t7xqcTZsV" target="_blank">[1]</a></span>. Despite a few minor mistakes, the run was widely considered to be "basically sub 41 minutes" and solidified his reputation as a top-tier runner.</p>

<p>His completed no-hit runs include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Dark Souls</em> – No Hit Any%</li>
  <li><em>Dark Souls</em> – SL1 All Bosses + DLC</li>
  <li><em>Dark Souls II</em> – No Hit Any%</li>
  <li><em>Dark Souls III</em> – No Hit Any%</li>

  <li><em>Demon’s Souls</em> – No Hit Any%</li>
  <li><em>Elden Ring</em> – No Hit Any%</li>
</ul>

<p>Ki11ahB is known for balancing mechanical precision with a lighthearted, often irreverent streaming persona.</p>

<h2>Cultural Impact</h2>

<p>One of Ki11ahB’s most defining contributions to the hitless scene was a nearly 40-hour period in which he wore mutton chops. This era, now referred to in niche circles as <strong>The Chop Epoch</strong>, is regarded as a turning point in hitless gaming history. Community leaders cite it as a moment when discipline, fashion, and sheer comedic audacity collided<span class="reference"><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ki11ahb/clip/StupidRespectfulBubbleteaTwitchRPG-WfKNNUKcsNeAwVh8" target="_blank">[3]</a></span>.</p>

<p>He is also known for the catchphrase <strong>"Come to Canada!"</strong>, a phrase often used during his streams to invite viewers—either figuratively or literally—into his uniquely Canadian brand of hospitality and chaos<span class="reference"><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ki11ahb/clip/AggressiveGentleWalletKreygasm-QHFassi9eOzxl57M" target="_blank">[4]</a></span>.</p>

<h2>Personal Life</h2>

<p>Ki11ahB is in a relationship with muse <strong>Juulnifer</strong>, who once laughed at one of his jokes. This singular moment of comedic validation sparked the (still unreleased) creative project often referred to as his comedy album. Despite never being published, the album is widely believed to have been a "success in spirit," with fans referencing it as a legendary moment in theoretical entertainment.</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>

<p>While still early in his career, Ki11ahB has left a lasting impression on the hitless and speedrunning scenes. His blend of elite gameplay, chaotic energy, and understated Canadian charm continues to inspire a new generation of runners.</p>
